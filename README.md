This is an experiment.

It uses stats.js, Author mrdoob: http://mrdoob.com/
Repository: https://github.com/mrdoob/stats.js/

It is based on the article http://articles.edwardsoft.com/private-prototype-functions

I try to follow and apply guidelines from the book Game Programming Patterns http://www.gameprogrammingpatterns.com/
