# gameJs
This is an experiment.

It uses stats.js, Author mrdoob: http://mrdoob.com/
Repository: https://github.com/mrdoob/stats.js/

It is based on the article http://articles.edwardsoft.com/private-prototype-functions

I try to follow and apply guidelines from the book Game Programming Patterns http://www.gameprogrammingpatterns.com/

Todo:
-Refactor and polish source code.
-Implement a physics component to decouple and generalize some logics from game objects.
  .Implement collisions.
-Abstract commands implementing the command pattern and use it in conjuction with state pattern.
  .Implement simple AI to drive object using the command pattern.
-Implement an audio component to play sounds.
-Implement UI component.
-Realize a demo game.
