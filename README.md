# gameJs
This is an experiment.

It uses stats.js, Author mrdoob: http://mrdoob.com/
Repository: https://github.com/mrdoob/stats.js/

I try to follow and apply guidelines from the book Game Programming Patterns http://www.gameprogrammingpatterns.com/

new core

Todo:
- Refactor and polish source code.
- Implement a physics component to decouple and generalize some logics from game objects.
  - Implement collisions.
- Abstract commands implementing the command pattern and use it in conjuction with state pattern.
  - Implement simple AI to drive object using the command pattern.
- Implement an audio component to play sounds.
- Implement UI component.
